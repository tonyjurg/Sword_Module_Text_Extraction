# Sword Module Text Extraction

This notebook in this repository demonstrates how to extract Biblical text from Sword modules using the [`pysword`](https://pypi.org/project/pysword/) library in Python. The `pysword` library provides an interface for accessing and parsing text from [Sword Project modules](http://crosswire.org/sword/modules/), which are widely used for digital Bible resources. In this example, we will load one Sword module and extract the the surface text for a specific book, chapter, and verse, and showcase how to display the extracted content. 

For more information about the Sword Project, visit [The CrossWire Bible Society](http://crosswire.org/sword/).

An overview of available modules is available [here](https://crosswire.org/sword/modules/ModDisp.jsp?modType=Bibles).
